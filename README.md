Hi everyone,

Are you looking for a fun and practical project to improve your React skills? Do you want to learn how to create a kanban board that lets you organize your tasks and projects in a visual way?

Iâ€™ve just uploaded a new video where I show you how to build a kanban board from scratch using React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS and dnd-kit.

In this video, you will learn how to:

Create columns and tasks with React components
Enable drag and drop functionality for both columns and tasks using dnd-kit
Edit the content and title of tasks and columns with inline editing
Style the UI with TailwindCSS utility classes
This project is a great way to practice your React skills and learn some new techniques and libraries. You will also end up with a useful tool that you can use for your own projects or customize further.
